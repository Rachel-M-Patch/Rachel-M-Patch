Nice to meet you! My name is Rachel Patch. Thank you for reviewing my project portfolio.

I have 2 years of progressive HR experience and 4 years of data analytics experience in R.
I am self taught in SQL and looking to move into an HR analytics role to combine my two areas of passion.

You can reach me at rachel.m.patch@gmail.com, or connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rachel-m-patch/).
